## Example in use
<img src="./project/iron-search.png" width="400" />

## Repository Purpose
This repo is responsible for the UI for searching movies. The interface and implementations of how movies are searched are controlled by the [movie-client](https://github.com/danielpadmore/movie-client)

## Installation
To run the project locally, clone the repository and use npm to install, build and test
```
git clone
cd movie-search-app
npm i
npm run test
npm run start
npm run build
```

## Usage
Using the app is intended to be as simple for the user as possible. The user types into the input, and results are rendered immediately in a search results grid.

## Next Steps
The next steps would be to complete the view for a single movie to display more details, add more features such as user logins, TV show searching and possibly animations.
